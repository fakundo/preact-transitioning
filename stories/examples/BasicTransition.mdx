# Basic Transition Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `Transition` component to handle simple transitions. The `Transition` component provides information about its current state, which can be used to apply animations or styles dynamically.

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how you can use the `Transition` component in your project:

```tsx
<Transition in={visible}>
  {transitionState => <pre>{JSON.stringify(transitionState)}</pre>}
</Transition>
```

## Explanation

- `in`: A boolean that determines whether the transition is entering or exiting.
- `transitionState`: An object that represents the current state of the transition, such as `entering`, `entered`, `exiting`, or `exited`.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo below to see the `Transition` component in action:
