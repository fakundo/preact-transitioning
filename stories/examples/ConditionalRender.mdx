# Transition Group â€“ Conditional Render Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `TransitionGroup` component with conditionally rendered children. By leveraging `TransitionGroup`, you can easily handle animations for elements that are dynamically added or removed based on conditions.

## Usage

To use the `TransitionGroup` with conditionally rendered children in your project, follow the example below:

```tsx
<TransitionGroup>
  {shouldRenderFirstElement && (
    <FadeTransition key="1">
      <div>First element</div>
    </FadeTransition>
  )}
  {shouldRenderSecondElement && (
    <FadeTransition key="2">
      <div>Second element</div>
    </FadeTransition>
  )}
</TransitionGroup>
```

## Explanation

- **`shouldRenderFirstElement` and `shouldRenderSecondElement`**: These are boolean conditions controlling whether specific elements should appear or disappear.
- **`FadeTransition`**: Wraps each child with animations for entering and exiting phases.
- **`TransitionGroup`**: Handles the mounting and unmounting of its children with smooth transitions.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo below to see the `TransitionGroup` in action with conditionally rendered children:
